Mouse Mover is a Python application that can be used to simulate cursor movement. This project is heavily inspired by the infamous [Mouse Jiggler](https://mouse-jiggler.en.uptodown.com/windows) application. One of the main purposes of using this application is to prevent screen saver or auto-lock in the case where you can't disable them.

## Download  
Download the executable for Windows from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/python-mouse-mover/) or compile the program yourself by following the guide below.
  
  
## Dependencies Installation

To install the dependencies, navigate to the project directory and execute this command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use Mouse  Mover, navigate to the `mousemover` directory within the project directory and execute this command:
```bash
python mousemover.py
```
| Settings | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Enable Timer | Enable and configure the timer this application will run. Disabling this will make the application runs indefinitely. |
| Random Movement | Randomize the movement of the mouse so that it doesn't leave any pattern. |
| Random Delay Interval | Randomize the interval between the movement. |
| Close Button Minimize to Tray | When enabled, pressing the close button will minimize the application to system tray instead of closing it |

## Preparing development environment

1. Download and install Python for Windows (tested using Python 3.7.7)
2. Using your favourite Git client, clone the repository to your development machine, eg. to `c:\projects\mousemover`
3. Open `cmd` terminal to your project directory, eg. `c:\projects\mousemover`
4. Create virtual environment with the command:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
5. Activate virtual environment with the command:
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
6. Install dependencies with the command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
7. Test that you can run `mousemover` with the command:
   ```
   cd mousemover
   python mousemover.py
   ```

## Compiling to Windows executable

PyInstaller should be installed in your virtual environment folder when you execute the dependencies installation above.

Execute the following command in the `mousemover` folder to compile to a standalone Windows executable 

```bash
pyinstaller --clean --onefile --add-data "config.yml;." --add-data ".\resource;resource" --icon .\resource\icon.ico --windowed mousemover.py
```

The executable will be available in the `dist` folder
